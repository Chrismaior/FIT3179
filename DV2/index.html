      <p class="caption"> Crime is not evenly spread across the globe, it reflects the pressures and opportunities within each society. 
        This choropleth map highlights the regions that contain the most crime around the world. We therefore see that Latin America carries 
        some of the world’s highest crime burdens, driven by inequality, drug trade, and urban violence. 
        South Africa also shows persistently high levels, linked to social and economic challenges. 
        In contrast, Europe, East Asia, and parts of Oceania remain among the safer regions, supported by stronger institutions and stability.
        These contrasts remind us that crime is shaped by deeper patterns of governance, opportunity, and community resilience, rather than being a universal experience.

    <p class="types-crime-caption">The Types of Crime charts highlight how regions face different crime pressures. 
      Europe and Asia carry the highest burden of drug offences, while the Americas stand out for homicides, 
      reflecting deep-rooted violence and organised crime. Economic and corruption crimes dominate in Europe, 
      showing systemic governance challenges. Meanwhile, violent and sexual crimes are spread across regions, 
      reminding us these issues cut across borders. Together, these patterns show that crime is shaped not just 
      by numbers, but by inequality, governance, and enforcement capacity.</p>

        <p id = "treemap-caption">This treemap represents the absolute total number of reported crimes by category over 20 years for each region around the world. 
        It reveals a clear imbalance in the <strong>types of crime that shape regional safety challenges </strong>. 
        In both Europe and the Americas, intentional homicide dominates the picture, 
        overshadowing other forms of crime such as sexual violence or theft. This suggests that, 
        despite differing levels of development and governance, both regions face a common struggle 
        with lethal violence. In Asia, intentional homicide again stands out, but alongside smaller 
        shares of sexual exploitation and other offenses, hinting at broader social issues that 
        coexist with violent crime.</p>
        <div class = "vert_section_break"></div>
        <p id = "treemap-caption">Taken together, the treemap suggests that intentional homicide 
          is not just another category of crime, <strong>it is a recurring and defining challenge across 
          regions</strong>. Its scale and persistence make it the most telling indicator of global violence, 
          which is why this dashboard shifts the spotlight onto homicide trends specifically. 
          By pairing this treemap with the <i>Time Trends in Crime</i> chart, users can move from seeing 
          <i>where homicide dominates</i> to exploring <i>how it has changed over time</i>. With interactive tools 
          like the moving average and time slider, the dashboard allows us to uncover whether 
          countries are successfully reducing violence, or if homicide remains an entrenched issue. </p>

              <p> Looking at how crime has evolved over time, intentional homicide shows a clear global arc: many countries reached their highest 
            levels in the early–mid 1990s, followed by a long downward shift through the 2000s, with stabilization or modest decline by 2018. 
            This pattern is not uniform, as Latin American nations such as El Salvador, Colombia, and Honduras display persistently high and 
            volatile rates, while Europe and much of Asia trend lower and steadier. By comparing single countries or pairs, the chart 
            highlights how social, political, and economic contexts shape safety outcomes over time. Intentional
            homicide was chosen because, as the treemap above demonstrates, it is the dominant crime category across all regions.
            To enhance exploration, the chart includes interactive controls: a country selector to compare different national contexts, 
            a time slider to zoom in on specific periods, and a toggle for a 5-year moving average that smooths year-to-year fluctuations and 
            highlights the underlying trend. Looking at its time trends provides the most direct lens into how societies work
            in improving public security. In many ways, these shifts reflect broader transformations, from 
            peace agreements to changing economic opportunities and law enforcement 
            strategies. Understanding these trends helps contextualize today’s crime patterns and the progress, 
            or setbacks, made in public safety.</p>
