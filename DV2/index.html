      <p class="caption"> Crime is not evenly spread across the globe, it reflects the pressures and opportunities within each society. 
        This choropleth map highlights the regions that contain the most crime around the world. We therefore see that Latin America carries 
        some of the world’s highest crime burdens, driven by inequality, drug trade, and urban violence. 
        South Africa also shows persistently high levels, linked to social and economic challenges. 
        In contrast, Europe, East Asia, and parts of Oceania remain among the safer regions, supported by stronger institutions and stability.
        These contrasts remind us that crime is shaped by deeper patterns of governance, opportunity, and community resilience, rather than being a universal experience.

    <p class="types-crime-caption">The Types of Crime charts highlight how regions face different crime pressures. 
      Europe and Asia carry the highest burden of drug offences, while the Americas stand out for homicides, 
      reflecting deep-rooted violence and organised crime. Economic and corruption crimes dominate in Europe, 
      showing systemic governance challenges. Meanwhile, violent and sexual crimes are spread across regions, 
      reminding us these issues cut across borders. Together, these patterns show that crime is shaped not just 
      by numbers, but by inequality, governance, and enforcement capacity. This breakdown shows how 
      tackling crime requires cooperation and tailored strategies.</p>

          <p id = "treemap-caption">This treemap represents the absolute total number of reported crimes by category over 20 years for each region around the world. 
        It reveals a clear imbalance in the <strong>types of crime that shape regional safety challenges </strong>. 
        In both Europe and the Americas, intentional homicide dominates the picture, 
        overshadowing other forms of crime such as sexual violence or theft. This suggests that 
        both regions face a common struggle 
        with lethal violence. In Asia, intentional homicide again stands out, but alongside smaller 
        shares of sexual exploitation and other offenses, hinting at broader social issues that 
        coexist with violent crime.</p>
        <div class = "vert_section_break2"></div>
        <p id = "treemap-caption">Taken together, the treemap suggests that intentional homicide 
          is not just another category of crime, <strong>it is a recurring and defining challenge across 
          regions</strong>. Given the strong persistence of intentional homicide, we will look further into how that 
          has developed over time in the next section.
          By pairing this treemap with the <i>Time Trends in Crime</i> chart, users can move from seeing 
          <i>where homicide dominates</i> to exploring <i>how it has changed over time</i>. With interactive tools 
          like the moving average and time slider, the dashboard allows us to uncover whether 
          countries are successfully reducing violence, or if homicide remains an entrenched issue. </p>

                <p> The boxplot below shows how, crime rates fluctuate between 2019 and 2023, 
              across the five continents. 
              Africa showed low and fairly stable levels with mild peaks in 2020 and 2022, while the
              Americas had the highest and most volatile rates, reflecting strong disparities across 
              countries.  Asia and Europe displayed moderate peaks around 2020–2022 before declining in 
              2023, suggesting gradual improvement. Oceania saw the sharpest drop, from high variability 
              in 2019–2020 to minimal levels by 2023, hinting at effective interventions or post-pandemic 
              recovery. Together, these observations highlight that progress in public safety is not 
              linear but closely tied to how societies adapt to evolving challenges over time.
              The trends highlight how governance and reform speed 
              shape safety outcomes.</p>
              </div>
              <div> 
                <p>Beyond the numerical shifts, these patterns reveal how crime is deeply intertwined with 
                  broader social and economic transitions. Regions experiencing political stability and improved 
                  governance tend to show sustained reductions in homicide, whereas nations facing inequality, 
                  corruption, or weak institutions often struggle with volatility. Post-2020 changes further 
                  reflect the global impacts of the pandemic, where disrupted economies, shifting law 
                  enforcement priorities, and social stressors temporarily altered crime trajectories. Regional 
                  differences show uneven progress, reflecting unique policy and social dynamics.
                  Overall, the charts indicate a general global decline in crime rates after 2020, though 
                  regional differences remain pronounced.</p>

              <p> Looking at how crime has evolved over time, intentional homicide shows a clear global arc: many countries reached their highest 
            levels in the early–mid 1990s, followed by a long downward shift through the 2000s, with stabilization or modest decline by 2018. 
            This pattern is not uniform, as Latin American nations such as El Salvador, Colombia, and Honduras display persistently high and 
            volatile rates, while Europe and much of Asia trend lower and steadier. By comparing single countries or pairs, the chart 
            highlights how social, political, and economic contexts shape safety outcomes over time. Intentional
            homicide was chosen because, as the treemap above demonstrates, it is the dominant crime category across all regions.
            To enhance exploration, the chart includes interactive controls: a country selector to compare different national contexts, 
            a time slider to zoom in on specific periods, and a toggle for a 5-year moving average that smooths year-to-year fluctuations and 
            highlights the underlying trend. Looking at its time trends provides the most direct lens into how societies work
            in improving public security. In many ways, these shifts reflect broader transformations, from 
            peace agreements to changing economic opportunities and law enforcement 
            strategies. Understanding these trends helps contextualize today’s crime patterns and the progress, 
            or setbacks, made in public safety.</p>

        Between 2021 and 2023, global resilience to organised crime showed small yet uneven gains across regions. The bar chart above shows
        improvements in <strong>international cooperation</strong> (+0.19 to 5.87) and <strong>national policies and laws</strong> (+0.06 to 5.48) 
        reflect stronger cross-border partnerships and renewed legislative focus on combating transnational crime. 
        These advances point to a growing global consensus on the need for coordinated frameworks and shared accountability. 
        However, progress in <strong>governance</strong> (4.70, −0.03) and <strong>transparency</strong> (4.36, −0.05) continues to decline, 
        exposing vulnerabilities in political integrity and institutional oversight. Many nations continue to rely on 
        <strong>security</strong>

         <strong>-focused responses </strong>such as law enforcement (4.87, −0.04) 
        and territorial integrity (5.06, −0.05), while social and community-based resilience efforts remain underdeveloped. 
        Civic indicators like <strong>victim and witness support</strong> (4.24) and <strong>non-state actor engagement</strong> (4.72, −0.16) 
        remain the weakest globally, signalling limited trust between governments and citizens. 
        Strengthening anti-money laundering (+0.02 to 4.71) and prevention (+0.08 to 4.55) initiatives has shown promise, 
        but sustainable resilience will depend on balancing enforcement. Overall, progress remains limited — 
        true resilience depends on pairing enforcement with stronger governance, integrity, 
        and community participation.
